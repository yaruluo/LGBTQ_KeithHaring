      <p>Legendary street artist and social activist Keith Haring has shaped the development of the LGBTQ+ community, particularly as a fusion between different scenes. Linking the divide between the art world and the street, Keith Haring rose to prominence in the mid 1980s when his graffiti drawings that transformed subway stations into canvases for political engagement spread to nightclubs, galleries and museums around the world. Haring brought together all his worlds: the art scene, graffiti scene, music scene, and nightlife scene. He attracted a global audience, universalizing the messages behind his work.  </p>

      <p>This object focuses on one facet of his work:  community. This handkerchief was an invitation for his birthday celebration in 1985, dubbed the “Party of Life”. His celebration took place at the Paradise Garage, an acclaimed LGBT nightclub, and objects like this handkerchief granted admission to attend Haring’s event. This handkerchief brought together people from all parts of Haring’s life, from Paradise Garage regulars to hiphop artists to notable music figures like Madonna. The graphic represents the vivacity and liberation he felt upon moving to New York City. Growing up as a gay man in Kutztown, Pennsylvania, Haring felt the need to find a place where he has the freedom to express his creativity and artistry. He felt the city was dancing and he needed the join "the dance." </p>

      <p> A notable figure in the LGBTQ+ movement, Haring used his art to confront social and political issues such as AIDS awareness and safer sex. His characteristic art involved fluid, bold outlined figures twirling and playoung around, happy but never aimless. Even after his early death from AIDS-related illness in 1990, his work continues to speak towards issues. He brought the LGBTQ+ world into the thriving alternative art community. </p>
